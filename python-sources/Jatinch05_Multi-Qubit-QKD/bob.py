Note: In a full QKD protocol, Bob would perform error correction (and privacy amplification)
after measuring the qubits to reconcile his results with Aliceâ€™s and to correct any errors 
introduced by channel noise. However, for this proof-of-concept simulation, we assume ideal 
conditions with negligible noise and perfect measurements. This allows us to focus on the 
core integration of QKD key generation with CP-ABE and AES encryption without the added 
complexity of implementing error correction.

In a production-level QKD system, you would need to implement an error correction protocol 
(e.g., Cascade, LDPC-based schemes, etc.) to ensure that the derived key is truly secure.
